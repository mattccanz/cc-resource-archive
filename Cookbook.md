In November 2013, a range of lecturers and researcher got together and wrote, in a weekend, 'Media Studies 101 - a Creative Commons Textbook.'

In 2014, Erika Pearson, who spearheaded the project, published the accompanying 'Cookbook', outlining the successes, failures and challenges of writing an undergraduate open textbook in 48 hours.
